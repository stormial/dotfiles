		+ leetcode
	-
	- configure shortcuts and remember:
		- gitsigns
		- neogit
		- diffview
	- fzf: exclude folders from <leader>f
	- fzf: review optional dependencies
	- fix the ctrl+hjkl navigation not working with Oil, ctrl+l has conflict
	- modes to resize and shift panes
	- learn quicklist  ->  search and replace

TMUX
	+ alt+z for zen
CLI:
	- `activate` alias
MISC
- renew dotfiles readme


current pain points:
- no signature autocompletion
- no tree of content, hard to work with json
- lsp errors are cut off, need to increase width of window to see
- bug with moving around folds with { and } - cursor stopping on the fold instead of going over

- "exact" search of the word in the project instead of fuzzy
- have a script that moves current vim config somewhere, and i use temporary one for testing. then switch back when i want
